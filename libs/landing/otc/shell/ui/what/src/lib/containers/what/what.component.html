        Over-the-counter trading, or OTC trading, refers to trades that are not
        made on a formal exchange.
        <br><br>
        In the context of cryptocurrencies, OTC trades are usually private deals
        made between two parties to trade cryptocurrencies. This would involve
        one party who is willing to sell their crypto assets at a given price
        and another willing to buy certain crypto assets at a given price. An
        OTC trading deal is made when both parties reach a consensus on the
        pricing that they want for the trade and exchange of the assets is
        settled privately between both parties.
        <br><br>
        OTC trading deals can also be done as a fiat-to-crypto exchange,
        crypto-to-fiat exchange, or even a crypto-to-crypto exchange.
